****** Lecture 1
       [2019-01-09 Wed]
******* Homeworks or quizes on friday.
	Alternated randomly. Always get a homework sheet regardless.
	Buffer: 100 * (Total Points earned) / (Total Possible points) * 0.9
	Only selected problems will be graded. Participation points for ungraded attempted problems.
******* Office hour Mon 3, Wed 1 (Math 220), Thu 10  
******* 100 hw/quizzes, 100 midterms, 100 final
******* Rings (or how I learned to love the polynomial)
******** Def: A ring is a triple (R, +, *) where R is a set and +, *: R \cross R \to R are two binary ops st 
********* (R, +) is an abelian group with identity O_r=O\in R 
********* For all a,b,c \in R
********** a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c
********** a*(b+c) = a*b+a*c and (a+b)*c=a*c+b*c
********* (R,*) is not necessarily a group. It does not necessarily have invereses
********* We say R is unital if R has a multiplicative id 1_r=1\in R. In a unital ring not every element has a multiplicative inverse.
********* If n\gt0 an integer then na = a+a+a+...+a and a^n = a*a*...a
********* In general ab \ne ba for all a,b\in R. If ab = ba for all a,b \in R then R is commutative. 
********* Examples
********** Integers, Rationals, Reals, Complex are all commutative unital rings under usual defs
********** For n\gt0 an int the set nZ={xn | x\in Z} is also a ring. 
********** If n\gt1 then nZ is not unital because the id is not there.
********** Assume R is a ring and n\to is an int. Let I={1,...n}. Let M_n(R)={a:I cross I \to R}. M_n(R) is a ring with the ops
*********** (a+b)(i,j) = a(i,j) + b(i,j) 
*********** (ab)(i,j) = \sum_k_\in_I a(i,k)b(k,j) 
*********** (M_r(R), +) is abelian group with id O_M_n_(R)(i,j)=O_r
*********** For any a,b,c\in M_n(R) and i,j\in I we have (a(bc))(i,j)=\sum a(i,k)((bc)(k,j))  
	                                                        =\sum\sum a(i,k)(b(k,l)c(l,j))
	                                                        =\sum\sum(a(i,k)b(k,l))c(l,j)
								=\sum((ab)(i,l))c(l,j)
								=((ab)c)(i,j)
********** If n\gt1 then M_n(R) is a non-commutative ring. If R is unital then M_n(R) is also unital.
********** For n\gt0 an int the set Z/nZ, which is a factor group under +, is also a ring. The multiplication is defined by (a + nZ)(b+nZ)=ab +nZ.
********** This is well-defined and makes Z/nZ into a ring. This is an example of a quotient ring
********** Every element has a multiplicative inverse iff n is prime.
********** Lemma(Rules of multiplication)
	   Assume R is a ring. For any a,b,c\in R the following holds 
*********** a0=0=0a 
*********** a(-b)=(-a)b=-ab
*********** (-a)(-b)=ab
*********** a(b-c)=ab-ac and (b-c)a=ba-ca
	    Moreover if R is unital then
*********** (-1)a=-a
*********** (-1)(-1)=1

****** Lecture 1 
       [2019-01-10 Thu]
******* Knights and Knaves 
******** Knights = always true, Knaves = always false, Normies = can lie or say the truth 
******** 3 People P M G one of each kind
********* P: At least one of us is a knave. 
********* M: *Says nothing*
********** If P = Knight \to statement is true \to M is a knave.
********** If P = Knave \to statement is false \to contradiction.
********** So P = Knight and M = Knave
********* P: Both of us are Knights
********* M: P is a Knight
********** If P = Knight \to Then both are Knights \to M = Knight  
********** If P = Knave \to P is false \to M is false \to M = Knave
********* P: G is the Knave
********* M: P is the Knight
********* G: I'm a normie
********** If P = Knight \to G is a knave \to G = Knave \to M = normie  
********** If P = Knave \to G is not a Knave \to G = normie \to M = Knight \to contradiction
********** If P = Normie \to G = knave \to M = Knight \to contradiction
