** No Forwarding
This sequence has two dependencies, instruction 3 and 4. So there is a
stall on instruction 2. Thus instruction 2 is in the WB phase. So on
the 7th clock cycle instruction 3 is in the EX phase. The 4th
instruction must be stalled in the ID phase.
** With Forwarding
With forwarding there is no stalls as there is no lw instruction. So
all of the instruction execute without stalls. By clock cycle 7
instruction 3 is in the WB phase and instruction 4 is in MEM.
