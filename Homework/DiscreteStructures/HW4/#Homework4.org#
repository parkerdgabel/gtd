D = 4 and P = 4. The overhead for the tree is n3P = n12 and the total
space for the tree is n(3P + D) = n16. So the overhead fraction is
n12/n16 = 12/16= 3/4
** 
D = 16 and P = 4. The overhead for the tree is n2P = n8 and the total
space for the tree is n(2P + D) = n(8 + 16) = n24. So the overhead
fraction is n8/n24 = 1/3
** 
Let n be the number of internal nodes. By the Full Binary Tree theorem
there are n + 1 leaves. So D = 8 and P = 4. The overhead for internal
nodes is n3P = n12 and the overhead for the leaves is (n + 1)P =
n4 + 4. The total overhead for the tree then is n12 + n4 + 4 = n16 + 4
= 4(n4 + 1). The total space for the internal nodes is n(3P + D) = n20
and the total space for the leaves is (n + 1)(P + D) = (n + 1)12. So
the total space is n20 + n12 + 12 = n32 + 12 = 4(n8 + 3). The overhead
fraction then is 4(n4 + 1)/4(n8 + 3) = (n4 + 1)/(n8 + 3).
** 
Let n be the number of internal nodes. By the Full Binary Tree theorem
there are n + 1 leaves. So D = 8 and P = 4. The overhead for internal
nodes is n2P = n8 and the overhead for the leaves is 0. The total
overhead for the tree then is n8 + 0 = n8. The total space for the
internal nodes is n2P = n8 and the total space for the leaves is (n +
1)D = 8(n + 1). So the total space is n8 + n8 + 1 = n16 + 1. The
overhead fraction then is n8/(n16 + 1).
