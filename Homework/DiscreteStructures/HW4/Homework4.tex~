\subsection{}
\label{sec:orgd38ceb2}
D = 4 and P = 4. The overhead for the tree is n3P = n12 and the total\\
space for the tree is n(3P + D) = n16. So the overhead fraction is\\
n12/n16 = 12/16= 3/4\\
\subsection{}
\label{sec:org2dcb8fb}
D = 16 and P = 4. The overhead for the tree is n2P = n8 and the total\\
space for the tree is n(2P + D) = n(8 + 16) = n24. So the overhead\\
fraction is n8/n24 = 1/3\\
\subsection{}
\label{sec:orgbbe42ab}
Let n be the number of internal nodes. By the Full Binary Tree theorem\\
there are n + 1 leaves. So D = 8 and P = 4. The overhead for internal\\
nodes is n3P = n12 and the overhead for the leaves is (n + 1)P =\\
n4 + 4. The total overhead for the tree then is n12 + n4 + 4 = n16 + 4\\
= 4(n4 + 1). The total space for the internal nodes is n(3P + D) = n20\\
and the total space for the leaves is (n + 1)(P + D) = (n + 1)12. So\\
the total space is n20 + n12 + 12 = n32 + 12 = 4(n8 + 3). The overhead\\
fraction then is 4(n4 + 1)/4(n8 + 3) = (n4 + 1)/(n8 + 3).\\
\subsection{}
\label{sec:orgf0ad8bf}
Let n be the number of internal nodes. By the Full Binary Tree theorem\\
there are n + 1 leaves. So D = 8 and P = 4. The overhead for internal\\
nodes is n2P = n8 and the overhead for the leaves is 0. The total\\
overhead for the tree then is n8 + 0 = n8. The total space for the\\
internal nodes is n2P = n8 and the total space for the leaves is (n +\\
1)D = 8(n + 1). So the total space is n8 + n8 + 1 = n16 + 1. The\\
overhead fraction then is n8/(n16 + 1).\\
